# Food ordering app

This is a React exercise project, it's an web application that allow user to order food.<br>
Here I am using basic React concepts such as:<br>
* props - to pass data to child components
* state/useState - to handle simpler states
* useReducer - to handle complex states
* createContext, useContext, Context providers - to share data between multiple components and avoid Lifting up state
* useEffect
* useRef and forwardRef
* createPortal to display Modal
